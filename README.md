# Machaera Altus Nox (Aurorae)

Machaera Altus Nox is a modern, color-schemeable KDE Plasma theme, with a futuristic, mechanical design.

Known Issues:
 * This theme can take up a lot of (visual) space, it is not recommended for smaller screens
 * Only looks right when the window border size is set to "Huge"
    - I have tried using custom sizes but they are not working the same way as this setting
 * The window title bar is very large, this can be reduced, but only if the correct font is chosen (see next point)
    - Uncomment the values in Machaera-Altus-Noxrc if you want to fix this
 * The window title text appears right next to the bottom of the title bar
    - To fix this, you can increase the font size, and/or choose a decorative font (these often have different baselines)
